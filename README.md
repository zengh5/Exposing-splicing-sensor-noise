# Exposing-splicing-sensor-noise
A noise-based image splicing localization method for the case that the source images are with distinct ISO settings

Demo for reproducing the result of

Run Splice_NL_ISO.m to see the the comparison results. The code has been verified on Matlab 2015a, Windows 10 64bit

# typos correction:
In the caption of Fig. 5 in [1]  
'... For display purpose, the noise levels in (a) and (b) are scaled to [0.4, 1.7], and the noise levels in (a) and (b) are scaled to [0.3, 2.3].'
       should be
'... For display purpose, the noise levels in (a) and (b) are scaled to [0.4, 1.7], and the noise levels in (c) and (d) are scaled to [0.3, 2.3].'  
We apologized for our carelessness
